was introduced?

    It reduced the time spent to find any typos.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more

    I could reduce the code size in the long run.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    It doesn't clutter up the commit history.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Git are focused towards coding.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    Using git bash.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    I will have my previous version saved in different file so any bug if
    introduced because of changes made by me can be solved easily.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
