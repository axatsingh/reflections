When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

I would use it to collaborate with others.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

So that I don't pull unnecessary commits.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

Forks are only on github. Clones are cloning the repository on local storage.
Branches are creating separate sets of commits.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

It will help when we have to work offline.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

Using some other medium. and github is much easier.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

use a separate branch when trying a new feature. else same branch is ok.
